# Django-quizz-site

Website created in django deployed with Railway.app connected to PostgreSQL database. The inspiration for the site came from a tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtQiiknWUcI&t=21186s&ab_channel=TraversyMedia. That's where i got the theme from. Most of CSS, HTML and JavaScript are also taken from this tutorial as my goal was to learn back end and learn how to use and implement already created theme. The whole idea aswell as CRUD, views, models, deployement, database connection, static files management etc. are my own work.
